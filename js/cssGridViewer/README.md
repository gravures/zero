# cssGridViewer

## About

This is a JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015) Class that creates an overlay to show the structure of CSS grids used in a web page.  Nowadays most browsers have a grid inspector, but i found it useful to have an unobtrusive one (without the developer tool pan open) when working on layout. 

## Usage

The class is named `CssGridViewer` and its constructor takes an object ([*parameter destructuring*](https://simonsmith.io/destructuring-objects-as-function-parameters-in-es6)) with the following properties:

- `selector` (optional): A CSS selector string or an Array of selector string to find CSS grid elements in the document. If not provided all CSS grid elements in the document will be used.
- `colors` (default: `a four colors array is provided`): An array of CSS colors strings to use for the overlays. Overlay's color will cycle on this array.
- `opacity` (default: `1.0`): A number between 0 and 1 to set the opacity of the overlays.
- `pattern` (default: `"lines"`): A string to set the pattern of the gutters. It can be either `"lines"` or `"board"`.



an example with no option, just pass an empty object:

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
   new CssGridViewer({});
});
```

and a more verbose version:

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
   new CssGridViewer({
       selector: [".grid", ".subgrid"], 
       colors: ['black', 'rgb(120, 30, 90)'],
       pattern: 'board'
   });
});
```

The class handle some key events:

- press [g] to switch on and off the overlay's visibility 

- press [n] to select the next grid overlay, this will highlight it and mask other ones

- press [h] to switch visibility of a typographic grid on the selected grid 

Enjoy!
